# Pathfinder (Processing)
> A program that finds the shortest possible path between two points.

A [Processing for Android](https://android.processing.org/) sketch written using [APDE](https://github.com/Calsign/APDE).
To run the project, download APDE on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calsignlabs.apde).

Pathfinder uses [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to determine the shortest possible path between point A and point B.
The points are randomly generated.
The map is drawn using an image. Non-transparent pixels are the paths.
To change the map, change the [map.png](data/map.png).

I made this project before because I was a delivery guy. I thought it would be cool if I can determine the shortest path when going to places. (Completely ignoring the existence of Google Maps XD)

The original version of this project is [this](https://github.com/NadieFiind/Pathfinder). I made this Java version for significant improvement in performance.
